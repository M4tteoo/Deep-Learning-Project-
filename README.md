# Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for Binary Node Classification

This project implements a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** using TensorFlow/Keras to perform binary node classification. The goal is to classify nodes in a graph given a sparse adjacency matrix and an initial embedding representation. This notebook was developed as part of a coursework assignment.

## üß† Model Overview

The GCN model follows a typical node classification pipeline with:

- Preprocessing Fully-Connected Layer (FFN)
- Two GCN layers for message passing
- Postprocessing FFN
- Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

Model enhancements:
- L2 regularization
- Dropout (commented for compliance with assignment)
- Layer normalization
- Optional weighted loss for imbalanced data
- Stratified train/validation/test split
